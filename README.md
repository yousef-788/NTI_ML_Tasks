## 📁 Structure

Each directory corresponds to a separate machine learning technique:

- 📦 **Data Preprocessing**  
  Data cleaning, feature scaling, and preparation techniques.

- 📈 **Linear Regression**  
  Implementation and visualization of simple and multiple linear regression.

- 🔍 **Logistic Regression**  
  Classification using logistic regression, along with performance evaluation.

- 🌀 **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**  
  Binary classification using SVM with different kernels.

- 📊 **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
  Dimensionality reduction and visualization.

- 📚 **Naive Bayes**  
  Classification based on Bayes' Theorem with feature independence assumption.

- 👁️ **MNIST**  
  Handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

- 🔁 **Bagging**  
  Ensemble learning using Bootstrap Aggregation.

- 🌐 **GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models)**  
  Unsupervised learning with probabilistic clustering.

- 🧩 **Clustering**  
  K-Means and other unsupervised clustering techniques.
